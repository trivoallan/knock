# `git` is a runtime dependency, not a build one: GitAdapter shells out to it for the
# git-sourced path (`ls-remote` to resolve a ref, `fetch` to materialise the tree).
# Without it a skill policy fails with `SourceError: git binary not found in PATH` —
# found by a real canary run, because the tests use the host's git.

# root fs — so regctl/buildctl can write their config there.
