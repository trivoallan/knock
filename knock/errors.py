    path that escapes the root, a non-canonical or duplicate archive path, an
    oversized tree, or a tree with no plugin marker. Raised both while planning
    (`knock.domain.packaging.plan_archive`) and while writing
    (`knock.adapters.zip_writer.write_archive`), since the writer re-checks what it
    can independently verify from the filesystem rather than trusting the plan."""

    The value comes from an upstream image, which knock does not trust, and `USER` has no
    quoting: anything outside a plain `name` or `uid[:gid]` is refused, never sanitised, so

    still fail — network, credentials, a server that refuses the request. An unknown ref

    instead, and for the same reason — a concurrent-modification race caught at the write
    boundary. Exit 2 because the remedy is environmental (re-run against the ref's new
