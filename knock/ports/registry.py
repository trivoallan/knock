        Takes a path rather than `put_referrer`'s in-memory `bytes`: regctl streams the
        file straight to the registry, so a large bundle (e.g. a skill zip) is never
        materialised in the Python process.

        Raises `DomainError` (a subclass) rather than pushing, for two caller mistakes:
        `blob_path` does not exist or is not a regular file (e.g. a directory — which
        the registry would otherwise silently accept as a bogus layer); or an
        `annotations` key is empty or contains '=' (which would be silently mangled
        into a different, wrong annotation rather than rejected).
