"""The git-sourced reconcile path: resolve, compare, then package and place.

Convergence without a tag list: the destination carries one immutable tag per placed
revision (`sha-<rev>`) plus a moving alias for the ref name. Both halves are load-bearing,
so convergence is a conjunction — *the revision is placed AND the alias designates it* —
and not just its first half. A ref can move backwards (a revert, a force-push, a release
branch reset), which leaves `sha-<rev>` present from an earlier run while the alias still
points at the revision the ref has since abandoned. "The revision is placed" answers yes
there, and a planner that stopped at it would report `skipped` while whoever installs by
ref name gets bytes the policy no longer declares — a silent disagreement between the
stamped facts and the policy.

Reading the second half costs one `get_annotations` per destination, and only where it can
change the outcome:

- revision not placed → the artifact is pushed and the alias moved regardless of what the
  alias says today, so the read is never paid;
- alias absent from the destination → the free `list_tags` result already answers it;
- otherwise → one read of the alias's own stamp, whose OCI-standard
  `org.opencontainers.image.revision` names the revision it designates.

A stale alias is repointed by copying the revision tag already in place — never by
re-fetching or re-pushing an artifact the destination already holds.
