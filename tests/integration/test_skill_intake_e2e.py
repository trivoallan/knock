"""End-to-end: a git repo becomes a stamped OCI artifact whose blob digest is its zip's sha256.

This is the only test in the slice where a *real* `git fetch` leaves a real `.git/`
directory in the tree that then gets packaged, and the only one that drives a real
`regctl` far enough to read the manifest back. Every other intake test runs against a
fake source handing back a pristine directory, so the VCS exclusion and the identity of
the layer digest are only ever exercised for real here.

It is hermetic and it **always runs**. The default target is `ocidir://` — a real OCI
layout on disk, written and read by the real regctl binary, with no server, no docker and
no network — because a test that is skipped by default protects nothing. Setting
`KNOCK_TEST_REGISTRY=host:port` adds a second, otherwise identical case against a
genuinely networked registry:

    KNOCK_TEST_REGISTRY=localhost:15000 .venv/bin/pytest tests/integration/test_skill_intake_e2e.py

That case skips when the variable is unset. It is an *extra*, never the only path.
